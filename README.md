# meltdown

## introduction
Hi! I'm Adi (pizzalover125), a Hack Clubber. On November 23rd, I hosted Counterspell Phoenix, a game jam. For some reference, I began work in late October and was very new to hackathon hosting. In fact, 
I only found a venue on November 5th, so I basically had 2 weeks to find sponsors and do outreach. Due to the lack of time, I was unable to accumulate many people and around 11 people came to the event. The only sponsor I got was Chik-fil-a. 

## why this event will be *different*?
Now, I have everything I didn't have then: experience, time, and a venue. Yes, the Arizona Center wants me to run more events! (In fact, they wanted me to make a monthly hackathon, but I don't have the funding or the time). Also, now, I have tons of data and experience regarding what works and what doesn't, so I'll be sure to utilize that. 

## aspirations
My goal for this event is to end up like Apocalypse and make it a really big event. That's the dream, but I need really hard for that. There are so many hackathons happening all around, so I have to do something super unique for this to count. That's why I have started preperations this far out (7-8 months)!

## why *meltdown*?
For some context, Phoenix is basically the world's hottest city. Daily highs in the summer can get to 115 F/45 C! For this reason, I felt like "meltdown" would be a great name, as things melt in hot temperatures. This is also fits the "Hack Club spirit."

## themes
I want to have a similar theme to Apocalypse. I'm thinking to make it a open-ended hackathon, where the theme is just "meltdown." Participants are welcome to interpret it any way they'd like. The only problem with this is that people can make applications/games before the event, which is considered cheathing (maybe enforce Hackatime?). Or, I can go completely like Apocalypse and make like a letter saying like "a nuclear meltdown has destroyed the world. make something to help the world" or something about the heat aspect.
